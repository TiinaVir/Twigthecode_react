# Twigthecode_react


This excersize is done 4.5.2019 10-17 during "React - beginners" workshop organized by #Twigthecode and #Mimmitkoodaa

The excersize itself is from this tutorial: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#taking-turns

The main idea was to create game using React. 
Workshop was fun and the game did work :).
I Try to continue with this work, maybe some css and finishing the game.
